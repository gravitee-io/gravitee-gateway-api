/**
 * A {@link KafkaPolicy} allows to define the actions to apply during the different Kafka requests and responses.
 * A policy can override the default behavior (which is, doing nothing at all) to execute during the Kafka request or response phase or on each message when the policy is able to work at message level.
 * In the case of records from ProduceRequest and FetchResponse.
 * The implemented methods will be called depending on the execution phase:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link ExecutionPhase#REQUEST}: {@link #onRequest(KafkaExecutionContext)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ExecutionPhase#RESPONSE}: {@link #onResponse(KafkaExecutionContext)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ExecutionPhase#MESSAGE_REQUEST}: {@link #onMessageRequest(KafkaMessageExecutionContext)}. Flow of messages is derived from Kakfa ProduceRequest data.</li>
 *     <li>{@link ExecutionPhase#MESSAGE_RESPONSE}: {@link #onMessageResponse(KafkaMessageExecutionContext)}. Flow of messages is derived from Kakfa FetchResponse data.</li>
 * </ul>
