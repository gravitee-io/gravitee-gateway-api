 * {@link KafkaSecurityPolicy} is a {@link KafkaPolicy} that can be used for securing a plan that can require a subscription.
 * Implementing a {@link KafkaSecurityPolicy} requires to implement some additional behavior in order to be used by the gateway during the security chain execution that will identify which plan the consumer is using:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #order()}: to define the priority compared to other security policies</li>
 *     <li>{@link #requireSubscription()} : to indicate if it require a valid subscription or not</li>
 *     <li>{@link #extractSecurityToken(KafkaConnectionContext ctx)}: to extract the {@link SecurityToken} from the kafka connection context</li>
 *     <li>{@link #authenticate(KafkaConnectionContext ctx)}: to validate the {@link SecurityToken} extracted from the kafka connection context</li>
